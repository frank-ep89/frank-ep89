This is the beginning of my journey threading in the developer path. My own way of expanding my knowledge and enhancing my skills.

Hello World!

I'm projecting the idea of my goal to make it a reality. I will become a FullStack Developer. 
The first step I'm going to take is to start with the Backend portion of the role. Wish me luck!
